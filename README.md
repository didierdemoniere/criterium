## criterium

Criterium is an open source project that provides a collection of parsers, validators and compilers for querying databases and search engines. This project aims to simplify the process of extracting and manipulating data from these sources, by providing a unified and efficient interface.

The parsers in Criterium allow you to transform raw text into a unified query structure, while the validators ensure the accuracy and consistency of this structure. The compilers take the parsed and validated structure, and translate it into a format that can be used by databases and search engines.

With Criterium, you can easily and securely execute arbitrary and complex query and extract the information you need, all in a fast and efficient manner. So if you're looking for a powerful tool to help you with your data management and extraction needs, give Criterium a try!
